# Demo: Python AST module, straight.plugin and nox

This is a demo project which illustrates:

- Using the [ast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) Python module to parse Python source and use it to enforce style guidelines and such
- Using [straight.plugin](http://straightplugin.readthedocs.io/) to implement the rules that are enforced as plugins
- Using [nox](http://nox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a replacement for [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - nox is the tox I always wanted.


## Setup/install

All you will need to do is basically install `nox` as per the docs and then run `nox`.
